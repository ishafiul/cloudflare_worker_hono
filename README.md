This repo is experimental. :P 

The main reason is that I'm obsessed with type safety. I just hate `dynamic` types in Dart and `any` in TypeScript. Recently, as a Flutter developer, I've been unlucky to work with a backend developer who doesn't share the same focus on type safety. Most of the time, they don't tell me what type of data they are expecting or what type of data they will return in response. Sometimes, for the same data model, they provide different field names, and I just hate that. -_- sorry...

Experiment with 
- Cloudflare Worker, 
- Hono,
- Hono RPC,
- Zod,
- Turso,
- Drizzle ORM,
- Flutter Swagger parser
