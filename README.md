This repo is experimental. :P 
> [!NOTE]
> The main reason is that I'm obsessed with type safety. I just hate `dynamic` types in Dart and `any` in TypeScript. Recently, as a Flutter developer, I've been unlucky to work with backend developers who don't share the same focus on type safety. Most of the time, they don't tell me what type of data they are expecting or what type of data they will return in response. Sometimes, for the same data model, they provide different field names, and I just hate that. -_- sorry...


Experiment with 
- Cloudflare Worker, 
- Hono,
- Hono RPC,
- Zod,
- Turso,
- Drizzle ORM,
- Flutter Swagger parser


> [!NOTE]
> I have already built a personal (private) project with this stack and deployed some services inside my Cloudflare worker. Therefore, I will not deploy all those services again. I will only deploy the services that are specifically needed to run this project and will reuse previously deployed services. However, I will include demo code for those services.
